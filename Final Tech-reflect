1. Technology-reflection
Can you share on why you are/were interested to study this technology discipline? 
This technology discipline class is a mandatory class to take within this degree field. Also, I feel that this class introduces us to the basics of technology which is needed to build upon more advanced technology studies. 
Do you believe technology drives society or does society drive technology? 
I think society drives technology. Without people, technology today wouldn’t be what it is or wouldn’t have advanced as much as it has. For example, if there was no need to call someone who doesn’t live in your area then there wouldn’t be a need for a phone. 
I think the next innovation era would be technology that would ease people to space travel. Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos both are just the initial pioneers of this technology. Before, space travel was only for astronauts and satellites. Now, normal humans are able to go out for a ride and view ( well the really rich ones). I think with more time and as tech advances, space travel will be normal and common for regular people.
